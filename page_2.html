        <h4>What does it mean to be a First Generation Student?</h4>
        <div>At the University of Michigan, we define first-generation college students as individuals whose parents or guardians have not attained a four-year college degree. This inclusive definition applies to both undergraduate and graduate students. While the University of Michigan adheres to this definition, all signature events organized by the University of Michiganâ€™s First-Generation Student Gateway are accessible to any student who believes these resources could benefit them.</div>
